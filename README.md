> Yosemite Valley, to me, is always a sunrise, a glitter of green and golden wonder in a vast edifice of stone and space.

-Ansel Adams

I'm a huge National Park fan, so I created a gallery of images featuring Northern California's very own Yosemite National Park. Credit for these images go to [Jeffrey Sullivan's Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreysullivan/sets/72157604010317412/with/16535808246/).

Click on any of the image thumbnails to open the lightbox, which can be controlled by both the next/previous/close icons as well as with key presses (ESC to close, right arrow to see the next image, and left arrow to see the previous image).

Additionally, any public Flickr album's ID and a number of images to display can be passed to it, and that number of images from that album will display in the lightbox.

### Ideas for enhancements
Some enhancements that could be made:

- Flickr's API doesn't the url for the image's Flickr page, but the url could be constructed with the info the API does return so that each image would click out to its Flickr page
- Include additional information the API returns in the UI (i.e. image tags, geolocation, date taken, etc.)
- Paginate the grid of thumbnails and display more than 20 images on scroll
- Make the page mobile friendly and allow users to interact with the lightbox by swiping.
